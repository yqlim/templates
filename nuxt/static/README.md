The `static` directory is directly mapped to the server root (`/static/robots.txt` is accessible under `http://localhost:3000/robots.txt`) and contains files that likely won't be changed (i.e. the favicon)

Example: `/static/robots.txt` is mapped as `/robots.txt`

_This directory cannot be renamed without extra configuration._
